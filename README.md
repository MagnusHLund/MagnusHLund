# Education
I am currently on a data technichan with speciality in programming education. 
This ends in May 2027. While I am not at school, I work as an apprentice as part of my education. 
This work consist of 2nd line support, solving bugs and even implementing new features for products. 

# Languages
### C#
I have been doing C# since around September 2020. 
That was in relation to game development in Unity, which I was taught in 10th grade.

### JavaScript & TypeScript
I have been doing some JavaScript here and there since probably the beginning of 2023.
In relation to my job, I started doing TypeScript November 2023. 
With TypeScript I then started learning the React framework in February 2024.

### PHP
As part of getting a better understanding of the code at work, I have been looking into PHP since late February 2024.
